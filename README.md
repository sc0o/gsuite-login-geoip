## About
A recent engagement required me to analyze geographic login activity for a GSuite domain. While Google makes several reports available on the Admin dashboard, there was not one that provided thorough geographic detail. I made a thing that would take the default Login Activity Report, enhance it to include GeoIP data and plot all of the data points on an interactive map.

Here's an [interactive sample map](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecapuano/gsuite-login-geoip/master/sample_map.html) containing fake data.

Marker color, opacity and size help emphasize noteworthy events. These values and their corresponding "keyword" triggers are defined in `geoip.py` https://github.com/ecapuano/gsuite-login-geoip/blob/master/geoip.py#L92-L111

Geographic data can sometimes make quick work of detecting anomalous or malicious login activity. The image below is a real world example of this concept -- the overseas markers were connected to unauthorized access to a compromised account.
